[(Et4NCl)(o-C6F4I2)2] packs in the C2/c space group. The asymmetric unit includes one mol­ecule of DITFB, one Et4N+ cation located on a twofold rotation axis, and one chloride anion also located on a twofold rotation symmetry axis. This compound has an inter­esting halogen-bonding environment surrounding the halide. Here, the chloride anion acts as a tetra­dentate halogen bond acceptor and forms a distorted square-pyramidal geometry, with I⋯Cl−⋯I angles of 80.891 (6) and 78.811 (11)°, where two crystallographically distinct iodine atoms form halogen bonds with the chloride anion. Resulting from that square-pyramidal geometry are short contacts between some of the adjacent F atoms. Along the b axis, the halogen-bonding inter­action results in a polymeric network, producing a sheet in which the two closest chloride ions are 7.8931 (6) Å apart. The Et4N+ cation alternates in columns with the halide ion. The expected short contacts (shorter than the sum of their van der Waals radii) are observed for the halogen bonds [3.2191 (2) and 3.2968 (2) Å], as well as almost linear angles [170.953 (6) and 173.529 (6)°].

Related literature   
The crystal structure of 3,4,5,6-tetra­fluoro-1,2-di­iodo­benzene has been recently published by our group (Viger-Gravel, Leclerc et al., 2014 ▸) and the crystal structure of Et4NCl was reported by Staples (1999 ▸). Reports by Abate et al. (2009 ▸), and our previous work (Viger-Gravel, Leclerc et al., 2014 ▸; Viger-Gravel, Meyer et al., 2014 ▸; Viger-Gravel et al., 2015 ▸) may be consulted for other similar halogen-bonded compounds containing o- or p-DITFB and ammonium halide salts. In these reports, halogen-bonding inter­actions are observed. Abate et al. discuss applications in crystal engineering. The latter reports describe the usefulness of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance to characterize these types of halogen-bonding environments (Viger-Gravel, Leclerc et al., 2014 ▸; Viger-Gravel, Meyer et al., 2014 ▸).

S1. Experimental 
Data collection results for [(Et4NCl)(o-C6F4I2)] represent the
best data set obtained in several trials. The crystal was mounted on a thin
glass fiber using paraffin oil. Prior to data collection, crystals were cooled
to 200.15 °K. Data were collected on a Bruker AXS SMART single crystal
diffractometer equipped with a sealed Mo tube source (wavelength 0.71073 Å)
APEX II CCD detector. Raw data collection and processing were performed with
the APEX II software package (Bruker, 2009).
Diffraction data were
collected with a sequence of 0.3° ω scans at 0, 120, and 240° in φ. Due to
lower symmetry in order to ensure adequate data completeness and redundancy
the initial unit cell parameters were determined from 60 data frames with
0.3° ω scan each collected at the different sections of the Ewald sphere.
Semi-empirical absorption corrections based on equivalent reflections were
applied.

S2. Refinement details 
Systematic absences in the diffraction data set and unit cell parameters were
consistent with the monoclinic C2/c (No.15) space group for
[(Et4NCl)(o-C6F4I2)]. The solution in the centrosymmetric space
group yielded chemically reasonable and computationally stable results of
refinement. The structure was solved by direct methods, completed with
difference Fourier synthesis, and refined with full-matrix least-squares
procedures based on F2.

The structural model for [(Et4NCl)(o-C6F4I2)] contains one
ammonium cation and one chlorine atom located on two different two-fold axis
symmetry elements of the space group while aromatic molecules are located in
general positions.

In this structural model, the hydrogen atom positions were located from the
differences in Fourier maps. However, after initial positioning, all hydrogen
atomic positions were constrained to suitable geometries and subsequently
treated as idealized contributions. All scattering factors are contained in
several versions of the SHELXTL program library, with the latest version used
being v.6.12 (Sheldrick, 2008).

Special details
Experimental. Data collection is performed with three batch runs at phi = 0.00 ° (650
frames), at phi = 120.00 ° (650 frames), and at phi = 240.00 ° (650 frames).
Frame width = 0.30 ° in omega. Data is merged, corrected for decay (if any),
and treated with multi-scan absorption corrections (if required). All
symmetry-equivalent reflections are merged for centrosymmetric data. Friedel
pairs are not merged for noncentrosymmetric data.	
Geometry. All e.s.d.'s (except the e.s.d. in the dihedral angle between two l.s. planes)
are estimated using the full covariance matrix. The cell e.s.d.'s are taken
into account individually in the estimation of e.s.d.'s in distances, angles
and torsion angles; correlations between e.s.d.'s in cell parameters are only
used when they are defined by crystal symmetry. An approximate (isotropic)
treatment of cell e.s.d.'s is used for estimating e.s.d.'s involving l.s.
