In addition, there is an intra­molecular (hydrox­yl)O—H⋯O(carbox­yl) hydrogen-bonding inter­action.

Mutual carbox­yl–carboxyl O—H⋯O hydrogen bonds link the mol­ecules of the title compound, C7H5BrO3, into centrosymmetric dimers which display a central R

2(8) ring motif. In addition, there is an intra­molecular hydrox­yl–carboxyl O—H⋯O inter­action present. A comparison with the crystal structures of 59 other substituted derivatives of salicylic acid shows that both the centrosymmetric carbox­yl–carboxyl O—H⋯O dimer and the stacking mode of mol­ecules along the short a axis observed in the title structure are frequent packing motifs in this set.

Chemical context   
Substituted derivatives of salicylic acid are widely used in organic synthesis and can be biologically active. Members of this class have served as model compounds for studies of crystal polymorphism (Sarma et al., 2010 ▸; Braun et al., 2011 ▸), the stability of hydrogen bonds (Bawa et al., 2004 ▸; Adam et al., 2010 ▸) or for systematic investigations of crystal-packing relationships (Montis & Hursthouse, 2012 ▸). The title compound is used in the synthesis of 7-bromo­benzoxazolin-2-one (Laus et al., 2011 ▸), which is an inter­mediate in the synthesis of bifeprunox, an experimental drug for the treatment of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (Zwier et al., 2005 ▸; Eijgendaal et al., 2006 ▸).


Structural commentary   
The mol­ecule is almost planar (Fig. 1 ▸). The plane defined by the non-H atoms of the carboxyl group is slightly twisted by 4.7 (4)° to the mean plane of the phenyl ring. An intra­molecular hydrogen bond, O1—H1⋯O3 (Table 1 ▸), connects the hydroxyl group bonded to C2 with the carboxyl group at C1.

Supra­molecular features   
Neighbouring mol­ecules are linked to one another by a two-point O2—H2⋯O3(−x + 2, −y, −z + 1) connection involving a pair of anti­parallel inter­actions between their carboxyl groups (Fig. 2 ▸, Table 1 ▸). The resulting centrosymmetric dimer is described by the graph set (8) (Etter et al. 1990 ▸; Bernstein et al., 1995 ▸). In the crystal structure, the dimers, which are essentially planar units, assemble into slightly corrugated sheets which lie parallel to the (10) plane. A sheet of this kind contains a short C4—H4⋯O1(−x + , y + , −z + ) contact (H⋯O = 2.57 Å, C—H⋯O = 145.7°) (Fig. 3 ▸
a) which involves the hydroxyl group at C2. The sheets are stacked in a parallel fashion in the a-axis direction with an inter­sheet separation of 3.798 (4) Å which corresponds to the length of this axis.

Database survey   
A systematic study of packing motifs present in 24 crystal structures of monosubstituted derivatives of salicylic acid has previously been published by Montis & Hursthouse (2012 ▸), who also proposed a nomenclature where a substituent Rn at a ring position n (n = 3, 4, 5 or 6) is encoded n-Rn (Fig. 4 ▸; Rn ≠ H). The title compound of the present study is denoted 3-Br in this system. Our own survey of the Cambridge Structural Database (version 5.25; Groom & Allen, 2014 ▸) revealed 59 unique crystal structures of salicylic acid derivatives, listed in Table S1 of the Supporting information, which are close structural analogues of 3-Br. This set includes several polysubstituted derivatives as well as multiple-component crystals and crystal structures containing potential hydrogen bond donor and acceptor sites in addition to those of the 1-hydroxyl and 2-carboxyl groups.

In order to establish the possible existence of geometrically similar substructure units, pairwise XPac comparisons (Gelbrich & Hursthouse, 2005 ▸) were carried out between the crystal structure of 3-Br on one hand and each of the other 59 salicylic acid derivatives on the other. Analogous to the study by Montis & Hursthouse (2012 ▸), the underlying calculations were based on the comparison of inter­molecular geometrical parameters generated from the ten non-H atomic positions of the salicylic acid mol­ecular core (C7O3) which is present in all compounds of the set. A qu­anti­tative descriptor, the dissimilarity index x
10 (Gelbrich et al., 2012 ▸), was calculated for each common supra­molecular construct (SC) identified. In general, a larger x
10 value indicates a lower degree of similarity and an x
10 value significantly higher than 10 is consistent with a situation where the fundamental features of a 3-Br substructure unit are also present in a second crystal, albeit with considerable geometrical modifications.

41 structures of the investigated set, including 3-Br, contain (carbox­yl)O—H⋯O(carbox­yl) hydrogen-bonded dimers with a central (8) ring motif (Fig. 2 ▸). All of the dimers are centrosymmetric, except for that of 3-COOH (Mereiter et al., 2001 ▸). In the latter structure, the (8) ring motif is inter­sected by a glide plane and connects the 2-carboxyl group of one mol­ecule with the 3-carboxyl group of the other so that an hydrogen-bonded chain structure is formed. Owing to the rigidity of the aromatic ring and the limited rotational flexibility about the C1—C7 bond, all 40 centrosymmetric dimers adopt approximately the same geometry, and the corres­ponding x
10 values are smaller than 12 (Table S1 of the Supporting information). In keeping with the nomenclature introduced by Montis & Hursthouse (2012 ▸), we denote this dimer SC A0.

A one-periodic SC, denoted X11 by Montis & Hursthouse (2012 ▸), describes the stacking of 3-Br mol­ecules along the shortest crystallographic axis [a axis; Fig. 5 ▸(right)]. We have identified another 21 examples of the same stacking mode (Table S1 of the Supporting Information) and the 13 best matches with x
10 > 12 are listed in Table 2 ▸. In this latter subset, the length of the stacking vector varies from 3.67 to 3.98 Å. Moreover, the eleven structures listed in the top section of Table 2 ▸ also contain a centrosymmetric dimer so that their common SC is actually a stack of dimers [denoted A11; Fig. 5 ▸(right)].

Other noteworthy packing relationships exist between 3-Br and the structures of 3,5-Br (XISGEM; Liu et al., 2008 ▸) and 3,5-Cl (WECXAE; Gao et al., 2005 ▸). These are based on the sheet structure which lies parallel to (10) in the 3-Br crystal and is depicted in Fig. 3 ▸
a. The corresponding x
10 values of 11.8 and 12.4 for this 2-periodic SC [denoted S2 in Fig. 5 ▸(left)] indicate a relaxed form of geometrical similarity, which is consistent with the accommodation of additional halogen substituents in the planes of 3,5-Cl and 3,5-Br. Moreover, the short C4—H4⋯O1 contact found in 3-Br (see above) is replaced by other close contacts in the S2 instances of 3,5-Br and 3,5-Cl. Table S2 of the Supporting information contains the corresponding crystallographic parameters associated with SC S2. A graphical overview of the packing relationships involving 3-Br and their inter­dependencies is given in Fig. 5 ▸(left).

Synthesis and crystallization   
The title compound was prepared from 5-sulfosalicylic acid by bromination, followed by desulfonation in hot phospho­ric acid and, finally, purification by steam distillation, as described by Meldrum & Shah (1923 ▸). Single crystals were obtained by recrystallisation from hot water.

Refinement   
Crystal data, data collection and structure refinement details are summarized in Table 3 ▸. Positions of hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon atoms were generated in idealized geometries using a riding model and their displacement parameters were set to U
iso(H) = 1.2 U
eq(C). The H atoms attached to O were identified from difference Fourier maps and their positions refined with restrained distances [O—H 0.86 (2) Å] and their isotropic thermal displacement parameters were refined freely.

Special details
Geometry. All e.s.d.'s (except the e.s.d. in the dihedral angle between two l.s. planes)
are estimated using the full covariance matrix. The cell e.s.d.'s are taken
into account individually in the estimation of e.s.d.'s in distances, angles
and torsion angles; correlations between e.s.d.'s in cell parameters are only
used when they are defined by crystal symmetry. An approximate (isotropic)
treatment of cell e.s.d.'s is used for estimating e.s.d.'s involving l.s.
