¡@ Introduction: The high prevalence of myopia among Asians led the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) to introduce photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) as a means of enlarging its pilot recruitment pool at the end of 2005. This study aims to address the effi cacy and safety of PRK performed on young Asian patients with low-moderate myopia, as well as audit the RSAF¡¦  s corneal refractive surgery (CRS) program.  Methods: 16¡V 2 7 yr) (1 4) . Of further concern, therefore, is the observation of an even higher prevalence of myopia among young Asians, ostensibly due to the presence of a cohort effect (8 , 1 0) . In Singapore, the prevalence of myopia among military conscripts has increased by 19.9% from 19871992 ( 2 ) to 1996-1997 ( 27 ), and by a further 2.3% in 20092010 ( 19 ). This is a retrospective case series of 149 eyes of 76 consecutive patients Delivered by Ingenta to: National Taiwan Nornal University The RSAF introduced its corneal refractive surgery Brian See, Marcus Tan, Sin Eng Chia, Wee Hoe Gan, Robin Low, and Gerard Nah

Of the patients, 96.1% were men and all were of Asian origin. At the 12-mo follow-up, 98.5% of eyes had an uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) of   0.00 LogMAR, 100.0% of eyes had an SE refraction of within  6 0.50 D of intended correction, and 2.3% of eyes had a loss of corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) of   0.20 LogMAR. The cumulative incidence of retreatments was 6.7% and cumulative incidence of grade II or worse corneal haze requiring retreatment was 6.0%. Refractive stability was achieved at 3 mo postsurgery.  Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that PRK performed within the context of a stringent and structured CRS program on young Asian eyes with low-moderate myopia is both effi cacious and safe, with refractive stability achieved by 3 mo.

aimed at enlarging its recruitment pool of potential military aviators and only permitted photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). Pilot applicants who satisfi ed all other medical and nonmedical requirements but had myopia with a spherical refractive error from  2 1.50 to  2 5.00 D and/or astigmatism with a cylindrical refractive error from  20 .75 to  22 .00 D were enrolled into the program. The decision to exclude those with high myopia, defi ned as spherical equivalent (SE) refraction of worse than  2 6.00 D, stemmed from the increased risk of other ocular pathologies, such as cataracts, glaucoma, and retinal detachment, among high myopes ( 18 ).

 Tcal equivalent (SE) refraction of worse than  2 0.50 D, is high in Singapore. Among its three major ethnic groups, the prevalence of myopia is 38.7% among the Chinese (2 6), 26.2% among the Malays (1 7) , and 28.0% among the Indians ( 15 ). The high prevalence of myopia in Singapore has been a long-standing cause for concern for the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF), as it has to balance the need to maintain high visual standards as a selection criterion with the confl icting requirement of meeting aircrew recruitment targets ( 21 ). A study of RSAF pilot applicants who underwent medical selection examination over an 8-yr period from 1984 to 1991 found that 19.8% of them were unable to meet eye refraction standards ( 13 ). Despite a subsequent relaxation of spherical error limits by  20 .50 D, the proportion of RSAF pilot applicants over the 8-yr period from 1999 to 2006 who were medically disqualifi ed because of unacceptable refractive errors remained high at 11.7% ( 20 ). 
¡@T he RSAF recruits the large majority of its pilot trainees from the cohorts of full-time national servicemen undergoing their 2-yr obligatory conscript service, with the mean age of a typical cohort being 19.5 yr (range: scarce. An Italian case series of 104 eyes of 52 patients (mean age, 22.1 yr) reported that at the 12 mo follow-up, 71.2% and 92.3% of eyes had an uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) of 20/20 or better and 20/40 or better, respectively ( 23 ). Another Italian case series of 80 eyes of 80 patients (mean age, 25.0 yr) found that at 12 mo postsurgery, 67.5% and 80.0% of eyes had an SE refraction of within  6 0.50 D and  6 1.00 D of intended correction, respectively ( 24 ). To our knowledge, there have been no Asian studies on the effi cacy and safety outcomes of PRK performed on young patients with low-moderate myopia.

Subjects 
¡@ This is a retrospective case series of 149 eyes of 76 consecutive patients that underwent PRK as part of the RSAF CRS program over the 5-yr period from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2010. Patients for this study were identifi ed using the RSAF Medical Service ¡¦ s PRK registry, and the requisite preoperative and postoperative data for each subject were mined from their paper-based medical records. The visual parameters documented were subjective manifest refraction, UDVA, and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA). In addition, postoperative corneal haze Hanna grades (5 )  and retreatments were recorded. This study was approved by the Singapore Armed Forces Joint Medical Committee (Research). 
¡@ All 76 patients who underwent PRK as part of the RSAF CRS program had to meet the prescribed eligibility criteria (Table I) preoperatively. The PRK operations were performed in a single center by multiple surgeons using a sponge for 20 s before washing.

 RESULTS 
¡@ The median patient age was 21 yr (range, 18 ¡V 26 yr) and the mean patient age was 20.9 yr  6 1.8 yr. Out of the 76 patients, 73 (96.1%) were men and 3 (3.9%) were women. All patients were of Asian origin. The mean preoperative SE subjective manifest refraction of the 149 eyes studied was  2 3.39  6 1.19 D. One eye had a preoperative SE refraction of  2 6.25 D, which exceeded the eligibility criterion by 0.25 D. 
¡@ At the 12 mo follow-up, 98.5% of the 133 eyes analyzed had a UDVA of 0.00 LogMAR (Snellen equivalent 20/20) or better, which increased to 100.0% for UDVA of 0.10 LogMAR (Snellen equivalent 20/25) or better (Fig. 1). For refractive accuracy at 12 mo postsurgery, 100.0% of the 137 eyes analyzed had an SE subjective manifest refraction of within  6 0.50 D of intended correction, with 81.8% of the eyes being in the tighter range of within  6 0.13 D of intended correction (Fig. 2). Of the 128 eyes analyzed, 15 (11.7%) had a loss of CDVA of at least 0.10 LogMAR (loss of   1 line), with 3 (2.3%) of the eyes losing at least 0.20 LogMAR (loss of   2 lines) (Fig. 3).

However, all of the 128 eyes had a postoperative CDVA Delivered by Ingenta to: National Taiwan Nornal Universityfavorably against the median proportions reported for of 0.10 LogMAR (Snellen equivalent 20/25) or better IP: 140.122.143.97 On: Wed, 15 Mar 2017 09:43:12these outcome measures among other PRK case series ¡@I n terms of effi cacy, our study found that 98.5% and 100.0% of eyes had a UDVA at 12-mo follow-up of 20/20 or better and 20/40 or better, respectively. This compares 
¡@
and a 12-mo postsurgery SE refraction of within  6 0.5 D.
¡@ Out of the total of 149 eyes studied, 13 eyes were complicated by postoperative corneal haze of grade II or worse (cumulative incidence, 8.7%). A total of 10 eyes underwent retreatment (cumulative incidence, 6.7%), with 9 eyes being retreated for grade II or worse corneal haze (cumulative incidence, 6.0%) and 1 eye retreated because of unsatisfactory refraction (cumulative incidence, 0.7%). There were no cases of post-PRK corneal ectasia among all 128 eyes studied. 
¡@A mong the 34 eyes that underwent review at 1 mo, 3 mo, 6 mo, and 12 mo postoperatively, none experienced a change in SE subjective manifest refraction of more than 
0.50 D from 6 mo to 12 mo (Fig. 4, top graph). Similarly, reports (UDVA of 20/20 or better, 70.4%; UDVA of 20/40 or better, 92.3%) ( 11 ). Consistent with our 1-yr postoperative CDVA fi ndings, 100.0% of eyes in our study achieved a spherical equivalent refraction of within  6 0.50 D of intended correction, which compares favorably against even the upper range limit of 87.4% reported in the systematic review by Murray et al. ( 11 ).

the 12-mo follow-up, has been reported in the literature to be 0.5% (range, 0.0 ¡V 1.1%) ( 7 , 11 , 12 , 22 ). In contrast, our study found that at the 12-mo follow-up, 3 eyes out of 128 eyes (2.3%) lost 2 or more lines of CDVA. Further review of individual medical records found that all three eyes had a preoperative CDVA of 20/12.5 and grade II ¡@T his study has several other limitations. Firstly, the case series design of the study renders it intrinsically prone to selection bias. This is especially true since all the patients in our study underwent a rigorous medical selection process and preoperative ophthalmic screening before undergoing PRK. Secondly, the use of medical records as the data source is suboptimal as the clinical entries for the eyes studied were of variable quality and the possibility of incomplete records causing skewed results cannot be excluded. Finally, data clustering of two eyes per person (2 5)  was not taken into account in the analysis of response. Supporting this argument are studies on refractive surgery in children, with pooled data suggesting that approximately 10% of pediatric eyes go on to develop moderate to severe corneal haze postoperatively ( 3 ). However, we also acknowledge that there have been studies that found no signifi cant differences in the incidence of corneal haze after PRK surgery in adult patients within different age groups ( 6 ). 
¡@O ur study observed that refractive stability was achieved by 3 mo after PRK surgery, with none of the eyes anal yzed showing a change in SE subjective manifest refraction of more than 0.50 D from 3 mo to 12 mo postsurgery. This fi nding is in agreement with the results of other published studies on PRK for low-moderate myopia (1 , 4 )  and supports the earlier revision in RSAF policy to return military aviators with uncomplicated PRK surgeries to fl ying earlier at 4 mo, rather than 6 mo, postsurgery. Due to the limitation of the relatively short follow-up time of 12 mo, we are unable to comment on the long-term refractive stability of eyes that underwent PRK as part of the RSAF CRS program. However, a recent 10-yr follow-up study on PRK performed on low-

As for the 12 eyes (9.4%) that lost 1 line of CDVA, all except 1 had a preoperative CDVA of 20/15 that worsened postoperatively to 20/20. Further review of medical records also revealed that the majority of these eyes had grade I-II corneal haze postoperatively. 
¡@P ostoperatively, 9 eyes (6.0%) in our study developed grade II or worse corneal haze requiring retreatment, which exceeds the generally reported incidence of clinically signifi cant corneal haze of 2 ¡V 4% ( 16 ). Nevertheless, these eyes were all successfully enhanced to meet the RSAF ¡¦ s visual requirements post-retreatment. We postulate two possible factors that could have contributed to our higher cumulative incidence: fi rstly, our surgeons may have lower thresholds for retreating eyes with corneal haze because of their knowledge of the strict visual standards maintained by the RSAF; and secondly, the patients in our study were uniformly young, with a mean age of only 20.9 yr. Regarding the latter postulate, the likelihood of corneal haze developing after PRK surgery has been hypothesized to be higher in younger corneas due to their more vigorous healing and infl ammatory dition (in this case, myopia), but receive different treatments (in this case, different intended corrections), then the results of an eye of a patient can be taken to be independent of those of the contralateral eye ( 9 ). 
¡@ In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that PRK performed on young Asian eyes with low-moderate myopia is both effi cacious and safe. From an RSAF viewpoint, this study supports the continuation of its existing CRS program from a clinical outcomes perspective, as well as the possibility of an even earlier return to fl ying at 3 mo post-PRK surgery. From a wider public health perspective, this study serves to provide an indication of the likely clinical outcomes to expect from a structured PRK surgery program for young Asians with low-moderate myopia.
